# About Unity IAP

Unity IAP makes it easy to implement in-app purchases in your application across the most popular app stores.

See the [In-App Purchasing manual](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/iap/manual/overview) for usage information, and the [Scripting API reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.purchasing@5.0/api) for details on the available classes and methods.
