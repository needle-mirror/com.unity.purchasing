# Backend Receipt Validation

Backend receipt validation helps you prevent users from accessing content they have not purchased.

For server-side content, where content is downloaded once purchased, the validation should take place on the server before the content is released. Unity does not offer support for server-side validation; however, third-party solutions are available, such as Nobuyori Takahashiâ€™s [IAP project](https://github.com/voltrue2/in-app-purchase).
