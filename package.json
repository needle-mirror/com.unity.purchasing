    "changelog": "### Added\n- GooglePlay - `IGooglePlayConfiguration.SetMaxConnectionAttempts(int maxConnectionAttempts)` has been added to specify the max connection attempts to the Google Play Store.\n- Apple - Added privacy manifest to comply with Apple's new privacy requirements. More details on how the Unity Engine supports this can be found [here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/apple-privacy-manifest-updates-for-unity-engine.1529026/).\n- Added `ConfigurationBuilder.logUnavailableProducts` to specify if unavailable products should be logged.\n\n### Changed\n- GooglePlay - The default max connection attempt to the Google Play Store has been increased from 1 to 3. See `IGooglePlayConfiguration.SetMaxConnectionAttempts` to configure this to a different value.\n- Apple - The log when retrieving products (SKProductsResponse) now also contains the invalid products count.\n- Improved `IStoreListener.OnInitializeFailed` for `InitializationFailureReason.NoProductsAvailable` by adding a message to clarify whether the store returned products or not.\n\n### Fixed\n- GooglePlay - Fixed AndroidJavaObject not being disposed causing a global reference table overflow in an edge case.\n- GooglePlay - Fixed bug causing BillingClient duplication resulting in ANR.\n- Apple - Fixed isFamilyShareable on tvOS to be only available on supported versions (14.0 and above).\n- Apple - Error codes when a purchase fails now always returns the code from Apple instead of defaulting to `SKErrorUnknown`.\n- Fixed Analytics' transactionServer being null."
