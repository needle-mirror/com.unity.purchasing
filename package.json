    "changelog": "### Changed\n- Analytics events are now sent when a purchase has been confirmed (`ConfirmPendingTransaction` or `ProcessPurchase` returning `PurchaseProcessingResult.Complete`). This will improve the accuracy of revenue tracking by no longer considering pending purchases.\n- Updated `Product.transactionID`, `Product.hasReceipt` and `Product.receipt` documentation to include pending transaction use cases.\n- Updated samples to use `IDetailedStoreListener` and its improved `OnPurchaseFailed` callback.\n- Added a new `RefreshAppReceipt(Action<string> successCallback, Action<string> errorCallback)` callback containing more information when the errorCallback is invoked in `IAppleExtensions : IStoreListener`.\n\n### Fixed\n- `OnPurchaseFailed` will no longer log an error when there's only new IAP Buttons with no IAP Listener.\n- Apple - Improved the accuracy of `Product.appleProductIsRestored` when using the restore transaction button. These will now correctly be flagged as true.\n- Codeless - `OnPurchaseFailed(Product, PurchaseFailureDescription)` callback was not invoked in `IAP Listener`"
