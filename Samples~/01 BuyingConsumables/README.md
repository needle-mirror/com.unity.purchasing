README - In-App Purchasing Sample Scenes - Buying Consumables

In this example, you will learn how to initialize the In-App Purchasing package and handle a simple Consumable Product purchase.

This sample uses a fake store for its transactions, to use a real store like the App Store or the Google Play Store,  
you would need to register your application and add In-App Purchases. 
 
Keep in mind that in this sample, product identifiers are kept in the `BuyingConsumables.cs` file.


### Consumables
Consumables are products that users can purchase repeatedly. Consumable Products cannot be restored.

Examples:
* Virtual currencies
* Health potions
* Temporary power-ups.

For more information about the In-App Purchasing package, see the [IAP manual](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/iap/manual/overview).
