## Getting Introductory Prices

From [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/implementing_introductory_offers_in_your_app):
> Apps with auto-renewable subscriptions can offer a discounted introductory price, including a free trial, to eligible users. You can make introductory offers to customers who havenâ€™t previously received an introductory offer for the given product, or for any products in the same subscription group.

`IAppleExtension.GetIntroductoryPriceDictionary` returns a dictionary of JSON encoded strings keyed by productIds.
