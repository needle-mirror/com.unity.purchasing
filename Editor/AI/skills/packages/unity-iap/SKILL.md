description: Implement, configure, and debug Unity In-App Purchases (IAP) — store connection, product catalog, consumable/non-consumable/subscription purchases, two-step pending-confirm flow, receipt validation, entitlement checking, restore transactions, Apple extensions (promotional purchases, Ask-to-Buy, code redemption), and Google Play extensions (subscription upgrade/downgrade). Use when the user needs to add, modify, or debug IAP. Triggers on microtransactions (MTX), monetization, real-money purchases, store purchases, buying items.

# Unity In-App Purchasing

Namespace: `UnityEngine.Purchasing` | Security: `UnityEngine.Purchasing.Security`
Package: `com.unity.purchasing`

**Unity IAP has its own initialization path** via `UnityIAPServices.StoreController()` → `store.Connect()`. It does not require `UnityServices.InitializeAsync()`, but they can coexist if your project uses other UGS services. If Analytics is present and `InitializeAsync()` is called, IAP will automatically send transaction events.

## Detailed References

- **API signatures & code examples:** See [references/api-notes.md](references/api-notes.md)
- **Platform extensions (Apple, Google):** See [references/platform-notes.md](references/platform-notes.md)
- **v4 → v5 migration:** See [references/migration-v4-to-v5.md](references/migration-v4-to-v5.md)

Read reference files on demand — only when you need specific API signatures, platform extension details, or migration mappings.

## Initialization Flow

1. Obtain `StoreController` via `UnityIAPServices.StoreController()` (or individual services via `DefaultStore()`, `DefaultProduct()`, `DefaultPurchase()`)
2. Subscribe to **all** required events (see Required Event Subscriptions below) **before** calling `Connect()`
3. `await store.Connect()` to connect to the platform store
4. On `OnStoreConnected`, call `store.FetchProducts(List<ProductDefinition>)` to load the catalog
5. On `OnProductsFetched`, products are ready for display and purchase

Use `Awake()` for initialization — ensures IAP is ready before other `Start()` methods.

Product types: `ProductType.Consumable`, `ProductType.NonConsumable`, `ProductType.Subscription`.

## Fetching Products

Define products as `List<ProductDefinition>` and pass to `store.FetchProducts()`. Use `StoreSpecificIds` when product IDs differ across Apple/Google stores. For complex catalogs, use `CatalogProvider` to manage product sets and store-specific IDs.

| Method | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GetProducts()` | Returns the **cached** product list (synchronous, stale if `FetchProducts` not called) |
| `FetchProducts()` | Queries the **store** for fresh pricing/availability and updates the cache |
| `GetProductById(id)` | Returns a single cached product by ID |

These are NOT interchangeable. Always call `FetchProducts()` first before relying on `GetProducts()`.

## Two-Step Purchase Flow

IAP v5 uses a mandatory two-step flow: **Pending → Confirm**.

1. `store.PurchaseProduct(product)` — initiates the platform purchase dialog
2. `OnPurchasePending` fires — you receive a `PendingOrder`
3. Validate the receipt, grant content to the player
4. `store.ConfirmPurchase(pendingOrder)` — finalizes the transaction
5. `OnPurchaseConfirmed` fires — receives `Order` base type; pattern-match `ConfirmedOrder` (success) vs `FailedOrder` (confirmation failed)

**You MUST call `ConfirmPurchase(pendingOrder)` after granting content.** Unconfirmed purchases are re-delivered on next app launch to prevent lost purchases.

**De-duplication:** `OnPurchasePending` may fire multiple times for the same purchase (e.g., app restart before confirmation). Always check if content was already granted.

**Consumables:** Confirmed consumable purchases are NOT returned by `FetchPurchases`. Track consumable grants yourself (e.g., in Cloud Save or Economy).

**Deferred purchases:** `OnPurchaseDeferred` fires for Ask-to-Buy (iOS) and Google Play deferred purchases. Do NOT grant content — wait for `OnPurchasePending` when approved.

## Restore Transactions

`store.RestoreTransactions(callback)` re-delivers non-consumable and subscription purchases. Each restored purchase triggers `OnPurchasePending`.

Required on iOS for Apple App Store compliance — add a "Restore Purchases" button.

Apple non-renewable subscriptions **cannot be restored** via `RestoreTransactions`. Track these server-side.

## Receipt Validation

| Platform | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Google Play** | `CrossPlatformValidator` with `GooglePlayTangle.Data()` — local validation supported |
| **Apple (StoreKit 2)** | Local validation is a **no-op**. Use `order.Info.Apple?.jwsRepresentation` for server-side validation |

Generate tangle data via **Services > In-App Purchasing > Receipt Validation Obfuscator** in the Unity Editor.

## Entitlement Checking

Use when you don't have the `Order` and want to know the status of a specific product (replaces v4's `product.hasReceipt`). If you already have the `Order`, check its type instead: `PendingOrder` maps to `EntitledUntilConsumed` or `EntitledButNotFinished`, `ConfirmedOrder` maps to `FullyEntitled`.

Call `store.CheckEntitlement(product)` and handle `store.OnCheckEntitlement`. Check `entitlement.Status == EntitlementStatus.FullyEntitled`.

`EntitlementStatus` values: `FullyEntitled`, `EntitledUntilConsumed`, `EntitledButNotFinished`, `NotEntitled`, `Unknown`.

## Fetch Existing Purchases

`store.FetchPurchases()` retrieves all current purchases from the store. Useful at app startup.

| Method | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GetPurchases()` | Returns the **cached** purchase list |
| `FetchPurchases()` | Queries the **store** for current purchases and **overwrites** the cached list |

`FetchPurchases()` replaces the entire cached list on each call. Only non-consumables and subscriptions are re-fetched — confirmed consumables are not returned (see Two-Step Purchase Flow above).

## Subscription Info

Subscription info is on `IPurchasedProductInfo`, accessed via `order.Info.PurchasedProductInfo` — **NOT on `CartItem`** (`CartItem` only has `Product` and `Quantity`).

`IsSubscribed()` returns `Result` enum (`True`/`False`/`Unsupported`), NOT `bool`. Use `== Result.True` for null-safe comparison.

## Required Event Subscriptions

**Always subscribe to BOTH success and failure events.** Not subscribing to failure events generates runtime warnings.

| Call | Success Event | Failure Event (REQUIRED) |
|---|---|---|
| `FetchProducts()` | `OnProductsFetched` | `OnProductsFetchFailed` |
| `FetchPurchases()` | `OnPurchasesFetched` | `OnPurchasesFetchFailed` |
| `Connect()` | `OnStoreConnected` | `OnStoreDisconnected` |
| `PurchaseProduct()` | `OnPurchasePending` | `OnPurchaseFailed` |
| `CheckEntitlement()` | `OnCheckEntitlement` | — |

**Always subscribe to `OnPurchaseDeferred`** — fires for Ask-to-Buy (iOS) and Google Play deferred purchases. Not subscribing silently drops deferred purchases.

Subscribe to events **BEFORE** calling `Connect()` — pending purchases from a previous session may fire immediately.

## Failure Description Property Names

These property names are NOT interchangeable — using the wrong one causes CS1061:

| Type | Field | Property | NOT |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StoreConnectionFailureDescription` | `.message` | `.Message` | ~~`.reason`~~ |
| `ProductFetchFailed` | — | `.FailureReason`, `.FailedFetchProducts` | ~~`.Message`~~ |
| `FailedOrder` | — | `.FailureReason`, `.Details` | — |
| `PurchasesFetchFailureDescription` | `.message` | `.Message`, `.FailureReason` | — |

## Validation

After writing code that uses this package:
1. Verify the project compiles without errors.
2. Confirm all API calls match the v5 signatures in [api-notes.md](references/api-notes.md) — do NOT use v4 legacy patterns (`IStoreListener`, `UnityPurchasing.Initialize`, `ConfigurationBuilder`).
3. Check the "Common v5 Mistakes" table in api-notes.md — do NOT use `OnStoreConnectionFailed` (use `OnStoreDisconnected`), do NOT pass callbacks to `FetchProducts`/`FetchPurchases` (use events), do NOT use `product.receipt` (use `order.Info.Receipt`).
4. Check that all required events are subscribed **before** calling `Connect()` (see Required Event Subscriptions table above).
5. Verify the two-step purchase flow: `OnPurchasePending` → grant content → `ConfirmPurchase(pendingOrder)`.
6. Confirm both success and failure events are subscribed for every async operation (`OnProductsFetched`/`OnProductsFetchFailed`, `OnStoreConnected`/`OnStoreDisconnected`, etc.).
7. If handling subscriptions, verify `IsSubscribed()` is compared with `== Result.True`, not cast to `bool`.
8. If updated files coexist with legacy versions in the same project, use a unique namespace (e.g., add `.Updated` suffix) to avoid CS0101/CS0111 compilation errors.
